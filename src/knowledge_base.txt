[SECTION 1: RAIN & WET ROADS]
Hydroplaning risk increases significantly at speeds above 35 mph. If the vehicle begins to skid, do not slam on the brakes; ease off the accelerator and steer in the direction you want to go. Wipers should be checked for streaking. Maintain a following distance of at least 5 seconds. Avoid cruise control in wet conditions to maintain traction awareness.

[SECTION 2: SNOW & ICE]
Traction is severely limited. Accelerate and decelerate slowly to avoid skids. The "Black Ice" phenomenon is most common on bridges and overpasses which freeze first. If driving in whiteout conditions, use low-beam headlights; high beams reflect off snow and reduce visibility. Increase following distance to 8-10 seconds. Winter tires are recommended below 7°C (45°F).

[SECTION 3: NIGHT DRIVING & FATIGUE]
The fatal crash rate per mile of travel is about three times as high at night as it is during the day. Depth perception, color recognition, and peripheral vision are all compromised in low-light conditions. Glare from oncoming headlights can cause temporary blindness; divert gaze to the bottom right of the lane. Circadian rhythm dips between 2:00 AM and 5:00 AM, significantly increasing the risk of microsleeps.

[SECTION 4: FOG & LOW VISIBILITY]
Visibility can drop to zero instantly. Use fog lights or low beams; never use high beams as they create glare (Tyndall effect). Use the right edge of the road or painted road markings as a guide. Roll down windows at intersections to listen for traffic you cannot see. If visibility is near zero, pull over completely into a safe parking area; do not stop on the shoulder.

[SECTION 5: HIGHWAY SAFETY]
High-speed merging requires matching the speed of traffic before entering the lane. The "Zipper Merge" is the most efficient method for lane closures. Avoid lingering in the "No-Zone" (blind spots) of commercial trucks. If a tire blowout occurs, keep a firm grip on the steering wheel, do not brake, and let the vehicle slow down gradually.

[SECTION 6: CLEAR WEATHER & DISTRACTION]
Even in clear weather, cognitive distraction is a leading cause of accidents. "Inattention Blindness" causes drivers to look at objects but fail to process them. Mobile phone use reduces reaction time by 30%. Sun glare is a major hazard during sunrise (Eastbound) and sunset (Westbound); utilize visors and polarized sunglasses.
